# About The Conference
The Blue Think Conference (BTC) is an annual meeting organised by the Interdisciplinary Centre of Marine and Environmental Research (CIIMAR) PhD Students’ Committee. Our aim is to gather all students affiliated with our institute in a casual and relaxed environment to share the outputs of our works. We welcome everyone to attend, hear and discuss the work developed by CIIMAR students.

The presentations include the different scientific fields within CIIMAR laboratories. Each session will count with the presence of renowned scientists who will talk about their scientific careers, professional experiences and most important work achievements.

We hope that this event will expand our scientific knowledge, but also bring closer CIIMAR students who work in different groups and laboratories scattered through several faculties and institutes of the University of Porto.

# Conference Venue

The Blue Think Conference takes place at the Porto Leixões Cruise Terminal, home to CIIMAR and most of its research teams. The space in use for both the presentations and the posters will be the third floor, a wide area with good natural light. Lunch and coffee breaks will also take place here. Be sure to visit the balcony in this floor, which offers a view to the beautiful coastline of Matosinhos!
