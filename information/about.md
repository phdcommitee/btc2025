# About The Conference
The Blue Think Conference (BTC) is an annual meeting organised by the Interdisciplinary Centre of Marine and Environmental Research (CIIMAR) PhD Students’ Committee. This year edition feature the participation of CCMAR, the "Centro de Ciências do Mar" of Algarve, PhD Students' Committee. 

Our aim is to gather all students affiliated with our institutions in a casual and relaxed environment to share the outputs of our works. We welcome everyone to attend, hear and discuss the work developed by CIIMAR and CCMAR students.

The presentations will include the different scientific fields within CIIMAR and CCMAR laboratories. Each session will count with the presence of renowned scientists who will talk about their scientific careers, professional experiences and most important work achievements.

We hope that this event will expand our scientific knowledge, but also bring closer CIIMAR and CCMAR students who work in different groups and laboratories scattered through several faculties and institutes of the University of Porto and Algarve.
