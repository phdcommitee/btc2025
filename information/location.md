# Location

The Blue Think Conference takes place at the Porto Leixões Cruise Terminal, home to CIIMAR and most of its research teams. The space in use for both the presentations and the posters will be the third floor, a wide area with good natural light. Lunch and coffee breaks will also take place here. Be sure to visit the balcony in this floor, which offers a view to the beautiful coastline of Matosinhos!
